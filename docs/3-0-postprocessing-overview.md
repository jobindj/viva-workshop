# **Overview of Postprocessing Workshop**

This part of the workshop introduces the postprocessing methodologies used for the VIVA+ model. For the simulation assessment, [Dynasaur](https://gitlab.com/VSI-TUGraz/Dynasaur) is used. It extends the Python programming language and thus can be used in Jupyter Notebook, which is a very nice tool, capable to visualize data along with a written documentation.

In this part of the workshop our aim is to introduce new users to the work with Jupyter Notebook and the use of Dynasaur to assess simulated results. 

!!! summary "In this workshop, you will learn" 
    - how to **use Jupyter Notebook** to document your simulated results
    - how the **Dynasaur controller classes** can be used for the assessment
    - how to **visualize simulated results** and communicate your improvements of the VIVA+ model


The workshop is not meant to be a programming class, it should give you, however, a notion how easy model changes can be tracked and documented using the skripting language Python and Jupyter Notebook.
