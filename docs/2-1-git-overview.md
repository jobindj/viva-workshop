# Overview of Git Workshop Lessons

This section of the workshop introduces you to Git. The VIVA+ human body models are developed and maintained on a Git repository, which enables version control. The VIVA+ Git repository is hosted on the OpenVT Gitlab platform. 

So what is Git? Git is an automated **version control** system. "Version control is a system that records the changes to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later."[^1] Git enables collaborative and open development of VIVA+ models.

The objective of this section is to introduce a new user to the concepts of Git version control and to introduce them to the VIVA+ models development workflow.

!!! summary "In this section, you will learn" 
    - to clone the VIVA+ git repository from OpenVT
    - the workflow to version control VIVA+ files
    - to get updates from the VIVA+ repo
    - to push your updates to the VIVA+ repo
    - learn how to participate in open development of the models using Issues board.

Although the illustrations in this workshop are based on OpenVT platform, the git workflow is similar for other popular Git platforms (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket) and you will be able to apply the skills you learn to any git repository.
