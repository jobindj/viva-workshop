# **Overview of Git Workshop**

This section of the workshop introduces you to Git. The VIVA+ human body models are developed and maintained on a Git repository. The VIVA+ Git repository is hosted on the OpenVT Gitlab platform. 

So what is Git? Git is an automated **version control** system. "Version control is a system that records the changes to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later."[^1] The collaborative and open development of VIVA+ models is enabled by Git.

The objective of this section is to introduce a new user to the concepts of Git version control and to introduce them to the VIVA+ model development workflow.

!!! summary "In this workshop, you will learn" 
    - to **clone the VIVA+ git repository** from OpenVT
    - the **workflow to version control** VIVA+ files
    - to **get updates** from the VIVA+ repo
    - to **push your updates** to the VIVA+ repo
    - learn how to **participate in open development** of the models using Issues board.

Although the illustrations in this workshop are based on OpenVT platform, the Git workflow is similar for other popular Git platforms (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket) and you will be able to apply the skills you learn here to any Open Source project.
