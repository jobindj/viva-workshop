## Why Version Control?

(Survey) How do you collaborate?

- Share USB drives
- Shared folders (DropBox/Box/OneDrive)
- Email files/zipped folders
- Version control (Git/SVN)

### Why use version control?

!!! Tip "Working in a Team"
    > Imagine if 5 co-authors worked on a paper together using 'Track changes'. Either they have to work sequentially (slowing down the process) or they would have to manually merge their contributions. Also, even with track changes, you lose the history once the changes are accepted. 
    > 
    > -   _“I will just finish my work and then you can start with your changes.”_
    > -   _“Can you please send me the latest version?”_
    > -   _“Where is the latest version?”_
    > -   _“Which version are you using?”_

    How cumbersome!
    
##### Roll-back functionality 

- Mistakes happen!
- Nothing commited to version control is ever lost
- Record of changes made: who and when. Makes it easy to track and go to previous version if needed
  
##### Branching

- work parallely or on different features

##### Colloboration

- Avoid accidentally overwriting or overlooking someone else's changes/updates. Good conflict management.
- Work parallel

### What can be version controlled? 

Not just software!

- Everything that needs to be shared 
- anything that changes overtime
- papers, books, datasets.

## Why git?

- popular and widely used tool
- Easy to setup - no server needed
- Efficient and distributed version control
