# Pre-workshop installation

## Install Git

If you have already a working installation of Git on your system, you can skip this step. Otherwise you can find instructions on the OpenVT platform to install Git on [Linux](https://virtual.openvt.eu/platform_manual_and_guidelines/manual_and_guidelines/wikis/installing-git:-Linux) or on [Windows](https://virtual.openvt.eu/platform_manual_and_guidelines/manual_and_guidelines/wikis/Installing-git:-Windows).

## Git GUI options

If you are more comfortable using GUI instead of command line, there are many [Git GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) available. 

Most of the VIVA+ developers currently use [Git Extensions](http://gitextensions.github.io/). In the workshop, the Git workflow will be illustrated using Git Extensions and it is recommended that you use this as the GUI client for the workshop.


## Install Jupyter Notebook

If you have already a working installation of Jupyter Notebook together with [Dynasaur](https://gitlab.com/VSI-TUGraz/Dynasaur) on your system, you may skip this step. Otherwise you can find further information about the installation on the following [page](0-jupyter-notebook-setup.md).
