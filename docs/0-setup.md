# Pre-workshop installation

## Install Git
If you have already a working installation of Git on your system, you can skip this step. Otherwise, browse to the OpenVT platform, find the wiki of the “manuals and guidelines” group. In the wiki, you’ll finde a section “how to get started with Git” – follow the instructions
- to install Git on [Linux](https://virtual.openvt.eu/platform_manual_and_guidelines/manual_and_guidelines/wikis/installing-git:-Linux)
-  or on [Windows](https://virtual.openvt.eu/platform_manual_and_guidelines/manual_and_guidelines/wikis/Installing-git:-Windows).

## Git GUI options

If you are more comfortable using GUI instead of command line, there are many [Git GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) available. 

Most of the VIVA+ developers currently use [Git Extensions](http://gitextensions.github.io/). In the workshop, the Git workflow will be illustrated using Git Extensions and it is recommended that you use this as the GUI client for the workshop.
